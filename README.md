# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of GeoJSON earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey. The user will be able to select from 3 different map styles, street view, satellite view, and dark view. The user will also be able to toggle earthquakes in the past 7 days, tectonic plate lines, and major earthquake (magnitude greater than 4.5) locations.
